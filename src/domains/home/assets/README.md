# Assets

## Purpose
This folder should contain all media data regarding this specific domain. Styles, images, vector graphics, language documents and all of the media kind of files. There is no place for logic code, please remember that.
In components asset files should be asked with `~` like `<div src="~/assets/folder/file.svg" />`

Please remember that files will eventually go into the bundle so make sure to keep them as small as possible.
The max file size we allow is 200kB, but this is already big.
